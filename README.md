# rock-paper-scissors
This is a simple implementation of the popular game Rock Paper &amp; Scissors using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

You can play this game by entering game() in the Javascript console of your browser or open the RPS.html inside the "GUI Version" directory to play the GUI version.

I did this project as part of The Odin Project's [Curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/rock-paper-scissors).
