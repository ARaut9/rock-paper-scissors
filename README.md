# rock-paper-scissors
This is a simple implementation of the popular game Rock Paper &amp; Scissors using Javascript.

You can play this game by entering game() in the Javascript console of your browser.

I did this project as part of The Odin Project's [Curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/rock-paper-scissors).
